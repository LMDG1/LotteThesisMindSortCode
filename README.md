# LotteThesisMindSortCode
The TypeScript code that I created for my Bachelor thesis in the language-learning application called MindSort.

Files:
- SelectionAlgorithm file: contains the code for the creation of the random and k-means clustering algorithms. 
- Other files: allow (amongst a few other small edits in other parts of the MindSort code) for smoothly integrating the 
selection algorithms with the rest of the MindSort code.
